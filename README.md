# Summary

Been searching for projects to test my newly skills, so i found myself building this simple game. The old Rock, Paper or Scissor Game, which must of us used to play as a child. Rock wins over Scissors, Paper over Rock and Scissor over Paper. Although, at first was challenging as for manipulating the DOM then adding the functionality needed. However, it was worth the time overcoming those challenges and fun at the same time.
